# Application Fixes

The following issues have been identified and fixed in the SolveSmart AI Angular application:

## 1. Code Editor Component Naming

**Issue:** There was an inconsistency in naming between the folder ("code-edito") and the component class ("CodeEditorComponent").

**Fix:**

- Updated selector from "app-code-edito" to "app-code-editor"
- Renamed component files to use consistent naming:
  - code-edito.component.ts → code-editor.component.ts
  - code-edito.component.html → code-editor.component.html
  - code-edito.component.css → code-editor.component.css
- Updated import path in app.routes.ts

## 2. About Us Component Duplication

**Issue:** The application had two folders for the about us page:

- "about-us/" directory (empty)
- "aboutus/" directory (with actual component)

**Fix:**

- Removed the empty "about-us" directory
- Kept the "aboutus" component as referenced in the routes

## 3. Environment Configuration

**Issue:** The environment.ts file had an empty API key value, which could cause issues if the application needs to authenticate with external services.

**Fix:**

- Added placeholders and improved comments about API key handling in both development and production environment files
- Used template string format in production environment for easier environment variable replacement

## 4. Folder Naming Convention

**Issue:** Inconsistent naming convention for directories, with some using kebab-case (e.g., "problem-list") and others using PascalCase (e.g., "Errors").

**Fix:**

- Created a properly named "errors" directory to replace "Errors"
- Updated the NotFoundComponent import path in app.routes.ts

## 5. Router Outlet Syntax

**Issue:** The app.component.html uses self-closing syntax for router-outlet which might not be compatible with older Angular versions.

**Status:** No changes made as the syntax is likely compatible with the current Angular version (using a self-closing tag is valid in newer Angular versions).

## 6. Created Code Editor Directory

**Issue:** After renaming the files, we needed to actually create the code-editor directory and move the files into it. The code-edito directory was still referenced in the problem-detail component.

**Fix:**

- Created a new src/app/code-editor directory
- Created proper component files in the new directory
- Fixed the import path in problem-detail.component.ts
- Updated the component selector in problem-detail.component.html
- Removed the old code-edito directory

## 7. Removed Duplicate Directories

**Issue:** After additional inspection, we discovered that both the old "Errors" directory and the new "errors" directory exist simultaneously, as well as the empty "about-us" directory.

**Fix:**

- Removed the old "Errors" directory completely as we're now using the lowercase "errors" directory
- Removed the empty "about-us" directory as it's not being used (the application uses "aboutus" instead)

## 8. Recreated NotFoundComponent in errors directory

**Issue:** After removing the old "Errors" directory, we accidentally deleted the necessary NotFoundComponent without recreating it in the new lowercase "errors" directory. This caused runtime errors when Angular tried to resolve the component path.

**Fix:**

- Created a new "src/app/errors/not-found" directory
- Recreated the NotFoundComponent files:
  - not-found.component.ts
  - not-found.component.html
  - not-found.component.css
- Made sure the RouterLink module is imported in the component to ensure the "Go to Homepage" link works properly
